	<description>Our Cedar Citrus CBD Balm has a blend of light fruit aromas and deep woody scents. All of our full spectrum CBD balms are made from a high-quality mixture of ingredients, including mango butter and beeswax, that is specifically tailored for topical use. We then infuse our balms with CBD hemp extract and all natural terpenes for scent. We carefully formulate our balms in our facility through a vertically integrated process that delivers high-quality products.</description>
